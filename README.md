# E2E Testing with Cypress üöÄ

This repository contains a project developed by following a tutorial on end-to-end (E2E) testing using Cypress, integrated with GitHub Workflows for continuous integration. The project focuses on automating the testing of a website with Cypress, capturing screenshots and videos of test runs, and utilizing GitHub Actions to streamline the testing process.

## Features

- **End-to-End Testing**: Automated testing of the website‚Äôs functionality, from loading pages to interacting with UI elements.
- **Cypress Integration**: Use Cypress to write, run, and manage E2E tests with ease, providing fast and reliable feedback on application behavior.
- **Automated Screenshots and Videos**: Capture screenshots and record videos of test runs, especially on failures, to help diagnose and fix issues quickly.
- **Artifact Management**: Store and retrieve test artifacts (screenshots and videos) as part of the CI/CD pipeline, accessible directly from GitHub.
- **GitHub Workflows**: Automate test runs with GitHub Actions, ensuring that tests are run on every pull request, push, or on a defined schedule.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- **GitHub Account**: Access to GitHub for repository management and running workflows.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JuliTheProgrammer/e2e-testing-cypress.git
   cd e2e-testing-cypress
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run Cypress locally**:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```
   This command will open the Cypress Test Runner, allowing you to run tests interactively.

### Running Tests via CLI

To run Cypress tests from the command line and generate reports:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

This will execute all E2E tests in headless mode, recording videos and taking screenshots of any failed tests.

## GitHub Workflows

The project includes GitHub Workflows that automatically run Cypress tests on defined triggers:

- **CI Workflow**: A GitHub Action workflow file located in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` sets up the environment, installs dependencies, runs Cypress tests, and uploads screenshots and videos as artifacts if any tests fail.

### Workflow Triggers

- **On Pull Requests**: Tests run automatically on pull requests to validate changes before merging.
- **On Push**: Tests execute on pushes to specific branches, ensuring continuous verification of the codebase.

## Artifacts

- **Screenshots and Videos**: When tests fail, Cypress automatically captures screenshots and records videos, which are then uploaded as artifacts to the GitHub Action run. These can be accessed from the "Artifacts" section in the GitHub Actions UI.

## Usage

- **Test Debugging**: Use the screenshots and videos generated by Cypress to quickly identify and resolve test failures.
- **Continuous Integration**: Leverage GitHub Actions to ensure your application remains functional across all changes with automated test execution.

## Learning Outcomes

By following this tutorial, you will learn:

- How to set up Cypress for E2E testing of a website.
- How to automate tests with GitHub Actions and manage test artifacts.
- Best practices for capturing and using test outputs (screenshots and videos) for debugging.
- How to integrate E2E testing into a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Workflows.
